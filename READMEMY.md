# A-weather-dashboard
A website to find weather reports around the country 

## Description

-The main goal for this project was to create a website dashboard for users to input a city name and get the current and future reports.
 
-The weather data was brought in by a 3rd party API called "Open Weather" 
 
-Was able to get a history tabe about the cities 

-The user is able to get the Temp and humidity.

-Need to work on adding other aspects that are in the acceptance criteria.

-Need to get the 5 day forecast in 

## Installation

To check the project, I worked on click on these links: 

GitHub: https://github.com/NBP77/Weather-Dashboard

GitHub pages: https://nbp77.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## Usage

Examples:

-Decent UI

-History bar that clicks previous searches and brings them up 

-Access to almost all Cities in the US 

-Gives you current Temp and humidity of city you searched


## Credits
Right at the end I was able to understand how to use the API and get the data and that really puts things togther for me but was unable to get a lot of the acceptance criteria.
